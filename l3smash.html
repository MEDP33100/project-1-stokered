      You're thirsty, claustrophobic, and scared. The last thing 
      you want to do is sit in this dark cavern and scrape two 
      stones together. You're just going to throw it and hope for the best.

    <div class="text" id="throwOutcome" style="display: none;">
      The stone shatters, and you see tiny fragments of glass as a piece
      of paper falls into the water. You reach for it, but it 
      disintegrates almost immediately.

      You walk back and forth, back and forth endlessly, until you can 
      no longer tell the difference between right and left.

      Hours or days or weeks later, you drink the murky water out of desperation.
      You wait for help to come.
      It never does.
