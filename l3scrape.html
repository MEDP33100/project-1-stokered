      Whatever is inside sounds pretty delicate.
      You start rubbing the softened stone against 
      the dry stone of the wall.

      Still rubbing.

      If the stone wasn't wet, maybe you could make a fire.

      Finally, the stone makes a hissing sound as a small pocket
      of air emerges. You look inside and see a corked apothecary tube.
      <!-- include animation of tube if possible -->
      You open it and find a curled up piece of parchment.
