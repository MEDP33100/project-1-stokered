# MEDP 33100 Project 1: Interactive Storytelling

## Project Overview

- I wanted to create a horror narrative story where users have two choices to figure out how to get out of the catacombs.

## Figma Design

- [Provide a link to the Figma design of the webpage.](https://www.figma.com/board/yOd6eRJc8Ho1qsLdxQwHkm/WEBP-Project-1?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=8ZsxOeb7FRMcynNC-0)
- Because this is a multiple choice narrative, my best design opportunity was to plan out all the different splits in choices and where they would lead. I wrote notes in the Figma sections of how I wanted specific parts to look.

## Features

- List the key features of the project, including:
    - **Animations**: CSS animations, GSAP effects
    - **Sound Effects**: sound effects are used when triggered by certain data-events to add to the realistic feeling of the game
    - **User-triggered Events**: clicking through the buttons
    - **Responsive Design**: using @media in CSS

## Technologies Used

- List the technologies and tools used in the project:
    - **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - **Libraries**: GSAP
    - **Other**: Github Pages for hosting, Figma for design

## Live Demo

- [Include a link to the live version of the project hosted on GitHub Pages.](https://medp33100.github.io/project-1-stokered/)

## Future Enhancements

- My original goal was for the user to find a note with four markings on it that could align with a grid, and then to come upon a stone that's patterned like a grid and have to press the markings that match with the note to escape. I tried to make this grid using eventListeners that and user input that matched as either true or false with what I wrote as trueInput, but I couldn't figure out the interactivity element and had to scrap it.
