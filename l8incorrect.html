      Something starts rumbling, and the stones start to shake.
      Some ancient curse rises through the small room and throws 
      it into a frenzy; the walls crumble around you with 
      astonishing force. You try to make it back to the hole and escape, 
      but it's too late. You are crushed under a pile of rubble,
      never to be seen again.
